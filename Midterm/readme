Guidelines for students 
 
The following list are topics for a midterm test in Principles of Database Management courses, 
at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, International University, HCM National University. 
 
Three students will be randomly selected to form a group. 
After formed, students in their group will work together on a given topic. 
Once again, a topic of this list will be randomly assigned to each group. 
During midterm test, students learn how to implement and analyze the database step by step. 
After two weeks, each group upload their result on the Blackboard IU. 
 
After choosing a topic, you have to study it and follow tasks in the topic specification document carefully. 
Try to discuss with your teammates to gain a deeper understanding about your topic. 
During two weeks, you can clarify unclear issues with your teammates. 
Remember that all the hard works are yours; teammates only give you some brief advices based on what you have done.

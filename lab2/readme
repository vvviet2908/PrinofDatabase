Task 1: Learning Transact-SQL and Query Editor in MS SQL Server 2014
<Follow Part 1 and Part 2 in the instruction of Lab 2 – Database system>

Task 2: Practising T-SQL
<Follow Part 3 and Part 4 in the instruction of Lab 2 – Database system>
Using/restoring the ApressFinancial database created in Lab 1, 
-	Create Transactions, TransactionTypes, CustomerProducts, FinancialProducts, SharePrices, and Shares tables. You need to declare integrity constraints, e.g. primary keys or foreign keys, for these tables.
-	Insert data into the tables.
-	Add a CK_CustProds_AmtCheck constraint on the AmountToCollect column in the CustomerProducts table: AmountToCollect > 0.
-	Add a DEFAULT(0) value constraint on the Renewable column in the CustomerProducts table.
-	Insert data into the CustomerProducts table.
-	Select data from all tables.

Note: If there are some problems with DBMS in your computer, you can:
- Download a miniserver (MySQL 5.0.67 Portable) from [4]. Just run the mysql_start.bat
file, type ‘mysql --user=root --password=root’ from the prompt, then you can start
a mysql prompt. To stop MSQL, run mysql_stop.bat.
